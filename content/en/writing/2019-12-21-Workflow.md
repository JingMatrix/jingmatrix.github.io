Here I introduce some basic workflows with computer; they streamline my daily life with mathematics.

## Writing Documents

At least I use LaTeX. To compile LaTex code, [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html) is more convenient for me than TexLive.

On Windows some subtle tasks require Adobe Acrobat DC, you can download the installer from official website [Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/fr/acrobat/kb/acrobat-dc-downloads.html) and use [amtemu](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Xf_W2wzc8whluYdVdA2AH4bluCEzGv4A) to activate it.

Now I am using Linux and have to give up Adobe Acrobat DC. If you still want an application with GUI to manipulate PDFs, there is an alternative for it -- [Master PDF Editor](https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/). And here I write a keygen for it:

<input type="text" id="computerId"><button id="activate" class="">Activate</button>

<code id="activateCode" style="white-space:pre">Enjoy it, so my work won't be useless.</code>

### Mathpix

Scan math formulae from documents. Apply from [Mathpix Dashboard](https://dashboard.mathpix.com/login) an `ID` and a `KEY`, substitute them in the following python3 codes. Then you will be able to use it 1000 times every month. This python module copies the OCR result to your clipboard automatically and stores history to save your free times of use.

On Windows, we use `ImageGrab` to export image from clipboard; as for Linux users, python module `ImageGrab` is no longer available for exporting image from clipboard; hence we should use `xclip` command from shell. Of course, we can do it directly with `bash`/`zsh` script, see my GitHub repository [Code](https://github.com/JingMatrix/Code#mathpix-for-ocr-math-equation).

The first script is for Linux and the second one is for Windows:
[Gist in Github](https://gist.github.com/JingMatrix/87a98d81dc7aaebca6510f9e4d3cfb67)

### Wolfram Mathematica

Download a trail version from [Wolfram](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/), use the [keygen](#keygen) below to activate it.

Mathematica supports dynamic and intuitive interaction and produces high-quality image within concise codes. Save images as PDF then you can insert them into your LaTeX code.

#### keygen

Supports Wolfram Mathematica 12.1

Input your MathID (xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx) and press **Generate**:

<input type="text" id="mathId" class="" /><button id="generate" >Generate</button>

<code style="white-space:pre" id="result">If bad luck, please try more times.</code>

### Inkscape

This free vector image editor [works perfectly][4bd1a504] with LaTeX. To copy a vector image from other PDF, select it in Adobe Adobe Acrobat DC and choose "edit with Inkscape"; then you can add some annotation and finally export it as PDF+LaTeX.

This part I want to introduce some basic work flows.

## OCR

[Mathpix](#mathpix) is suitable for light-weight OCR tasks. As for offline OCR tasks, Adobe Acrobat DC works on Windows. For Linux, [tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html) plus `xclip` is enough. Here we use two alias to OCR images from clipboard.

```bash
alias ocrchi="xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -o > /tmp/clip.png && tesseract  /tmp/clip.png /tmp/ocr-sim -l chi_sim &> /dev/null && cat /tmp/ocr-sim.txt"
alias ocren="xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -o > /tmp/clip.png && tesseract  /tmp/clip.png /tmp/ocr-en -l eng &> /dev/null && cat /tmp/ocr-en.txt"
```

## Add bookmarks to PDF

I want to have bookmarks, especially those serving as table of content, in every PDF so that I can jump freely between them. To start with, we need tools to import and export bookmarks in text form.

For Windows user, extension [AutoBookmark](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nTcxb72h9jXkWtSjk5DyvsJ210qKUU8e) for Adobe Acrobat DC

For Linux user, `pdftk` and `DjvuLibre` are handy then just head for [this script](https://github.com/JingMatrix/Code/tree/master/Shell/toc#add-bookmarksoutlines-to-pdf-and-djvu).

<style scoped>
@tailwind base;
@layer base {
	input {
		@apply bg-transparent focus:shadow-md border-2 border-gray-300 rounded-lg py-2 px-4 inline-block w-1/2 appearance-none leading-normal
