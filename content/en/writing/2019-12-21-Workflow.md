Here I introduce my basic workflow with computer;
they streamline my daily life with mathematics.

## Writing Documents

At least I use LaTeX. To compile LaTex code, [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html) might be more convenient than TexLive if a large installation is too scaring.

On Windows some subtle tasks for PDF documents
require Adobe Acrobat DC, you can download the installer from
the official website [Adobe](https://h`elpx.adobe.com/fr/acrobat/kb/acrobat-dc-downloads.html)
and use [amtemu](https://amtemu-official.com/) to activate it.
Now I am using Linux and have to give up Adobe Acrobat DC.
If you still want an application with GUI to manipulate PDFs,
there is an alternative for it -- [Master PDF Editor](https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/).
And here I write a keygen for versions older than 5.6.80 of it,
including versions for [Windows](https://web.archive.org/web/20200919162559if_/https://code-industry.net/public/MasterPDFEditor-setup.exe),
[Ubuntu](https://web.archive.org/web/20210203220337/https://code-industry.net/public/master-pdf-editor-5.6.80-qt5.x86_64.deb)
and [macOS](https://web.archive.org/web/20200919165215/https://code-industry.net/public/MasterPDFEditor.dmg):

<input type="text" id="computerId"><button id="activate" class="">Activate</button>

<code id="activateCode" style="white-space:pre">Enjoy it, so my work won't be useless.</code>

### Mathpix

Mathpix outputs Latex code from images or PDF documents.
For its API usage, I have a [shell script](https://github.com/JingMatrix/Shell/blob/master/mathpix)
^[I also have a Python script for its usage.
The first one is for Linux and the second one is for Windows:
[Python scripts for Mathpix API](https://gist.github.com/JingMatrix/87a98d81dc7aaebca6510f9e4d3cfb67).]
to do the setting-up job.
To use this script, 
apply from [Mathpix Dashboard](https://dashboard.mathpix.com/login) an `ID` and a `KEY`,
and then put them in _~/.config/mathpix_.
~~Then you will be able to use it 1000 times for free each month.~~
It is not free anymore from the September 2022
^[If the fee is too expensive, please consider [LaTex-OCR](https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR).].



### Wolfram Mathematica

Mathematica supports dynamic and intuitive interaction and produces high-quality image within concise codes.
Save images as PDF then you can insert them into your LaTeX code.

Download a trial version from [Wolfram](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/), 
use the keygen below to generate an activation code.
It works for Wolfram Mathematica 13.1 for my Ubuntu Kinetic Kudu.
Input your MathID (xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx) for offline activation
and then click **Generate**:

<input type="text" id="mathId" class="" /><button id="generate" >Generate</button>

<code style="white-space:pre" id="result">If bad luck, please try more times.</code>

### Inkscape

This free vector image editor [works perfectly][4bd1a504] with LaTeX.
To copy a vector image from other PDF,
on Windows you can select it in Adobe Acrobat DC and
choose _edit with Inkscape_.
Then you can add some annotation and finally export it as PDF+LaTeX.

## OCR

[Mathpix](#mathpix) is suitable for light-weight OCR tasks. As for offline OCR tasks,
Adobe Acrobat DC works on Windows.
For Linux, [tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html) plus `xclip` is enough.
Here we use two alias to OCR images from clipboard.

```bash
alias ocrchi="xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -o > /tmp/clip.png && tesseract  /tmp/clip.png /tmp/ocr-sim -l chi_sim &> /dev/null && cat /tmp/ocr-sim.txt"
alias ocren="xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -o > /tmp/clip.png && tesseract  /tmp/clip.png /tmp/ocr-en -l eng &> /dev/null && cat /tmp/ocr-en.txt"
```

For `wayland` users, I have a `zsh` function in
[my .zshrc](https://github.com/JingMatrix/Shell/blob/master/.zshrc) for OCR jobs.

## Add bookmarks to PDF

I want to have bookmarks, especially those serving as table of content, in every PDF so that I can jump freely between them. To start with, we need tools to import and export bookmarks in text form.

For Windows user, there is the extension [AutoBookmark](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nTcxb72h9jXkWtSjk5DyvsJ210qKUU8e) for Adobe Acrobat DC.
For Linux user, `pdftk` and `DjvuLibre` are sufficient,
see [my instruction](https://github.com/JingMatrix/Shell/blob/master/toc/README.md) for details.
